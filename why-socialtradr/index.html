       	SocialTradr uses data mining algorithms to harvest public opinion from 
		social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, as well as blogs 
		and online newspapers. This data is sent through a proprietary real-time 
		analytics system to generate reports, calculate insights, and detect trends. 
		Users will be able to access this information through a web-based interface, a 
		Microsoft Excel plugin, and daily or weekly email reports. <br/> <br/>

		SocialTradr is different because we specifically target financial 
		professionals. Our products complement the tools financial professionals 
		already use. We allow customers to track many companies. Our insights are 
		generated through a proprietary horizontally scalable, cloud-based system 
		designed for real-time processing, allowing customers to view quantified public 
		opinion as itâ€™s generated. And we harvest from the entire Internet, not only 
		one social media network.
