            Financial professionals give significant attention to the many economic reports released each month. However, 
			the data available in these reports significantly lags consumer habits by up to several months. SocialTradr 
			bridges that gap by providing real-time social media analytics to financial professionals. By measuring online 
			public opinion, SocialTradr offers insight about how companies and their brands are being perceived online that 
			investors can use to make informed decisions before the release of the next economic report.
