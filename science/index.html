    <p>SocialTradr operates on the hypothesis that public opinion influences company 
	performance and it can be measured using the social media networks. Intuitively, 
	this makes sense. There is also research in computer science, economics, and 
	sociology that supports this hypothesis. <br/>

	 “Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly 
	improved... We find an accuracy of 87.6% in predicting the daily up and down 
	changes in the closing values of the DJIA”<br/>

	“We find that events in the social, political, cultural and economic sphere do have 
	a significant, immediate and highly specific effect on the various dimensions of 
	public mood. We speculate that large scale analyses of mood can provide a solid 
	platform to model collective emotive trends in terms of their predictive value with 
	regards to existing social as well as economic indicators.” <br/>
